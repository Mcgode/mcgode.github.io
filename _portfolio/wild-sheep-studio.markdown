Back in May 2021, I joined Wild Sheep Studio, a game studio based in Montpellier, France, as a 
graphics/engine programmer for their project. More precisely, I was tasked with working on both 
higher-level (shaders,...) and lower-level (render engine) aspects of the project's 3D pipeline.

Due to confidentiality, I can't share anything at the moment, but I hope I'll get to show some of
the work I've done there.
